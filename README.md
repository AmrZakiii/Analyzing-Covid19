# Analyzing-Covid19
Analyzing Covid-19 dataset, the aim was to check two hypothesis using R.

a data analysis project that uses R programming language and several R libraries to explore COVID-19 line list data. The project involves reading the COVID19_line_list_data.csv file, cleaning the death column, and computing the death rate. Additionally, the project investigates two claims regarding age and gender: 1) people who die are older and 2) gender has no effect. The analysis includes subsetting the data for dead and alive individuals, and for men and women, respectively. The project also performs statistical tests, such as t-tests, and provides statistical insights, including the rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis.
