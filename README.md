# Analyzing-Covid19
Analyzing Covid-19 dataset, the aim was to check two hypothesis using R.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING

First Hypothesis: 
The media claims that older people are more likely to die than younger people from COVID-19. Is this true?
The data shows that those who die are older in our sample

Second Hypothesis: 
We want to see if the death rate is similar for men and women.
We see that men in this dataset have a death rate of 8.5% as opposed to 3.7% in women.
